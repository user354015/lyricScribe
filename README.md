## What?
A simple Go script that downloads, checks and displays the synced lyrics for the song currently playing using MPRIS.

## Why?
Nobody else was gonna do it so fuck it, I'm doing it myself.

## How?
1. Clone this repo ```git clone https://github.com/user354015/lyricScribe```
2. Move to the src directory ```cd lyricScribe/src```
3. Run the project, ```go run .```.

## Future of the project
This is my first real project and I plan to take good care of it. I have [many plans](/roadmap.md) for the future and will do my best to maintain and improve this for as long as possible. That being said, I am just some guy doing this on my (limited) free time and cannot make any promises.
